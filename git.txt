1. Repositories: A repository (or repo) is where your project’s files are stored. You can create public or private repos.

2. Commits: A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit includes:

3. Branches: Branches allow you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously. The main branch is often called "main" or "master."

4. Pull Requests: When you want to merge changes from one branch to another, you create a pull request. This facilitates code review and discussion.

The Commit Process:

1. Make Changes: Edit files in your repository.
2. Stage Changes: Use the `git add` command to stage files you want to include in the next commit.
3. Create a Commit: Use `git commit -m "Your commit message"` to create a new commit.
4. Push Changes: Use `git push` to upload your commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
